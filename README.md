# ClassicBASIC-Programs

Welcome to ClassicBASIC-Programs! This repository is a homage to the early days of programming, containing a variety of BASIC programs crafted over two decades ago. These programs serve as both a nostalgic reminder of the days when BASIC was a go-to language for many enthusiasts and a resource for those curious about programming's past. This is how I learned coding around the year 2000...

## Contents:

1. Euro-conversor.bas: A simple currency converter for Euros.
2. EC2GRAD.BAS: Handles 2nd-degree equations.
3. m.c.d. y m.c.m. de 2 numeros.bas: Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
4. Números_combinatorios.BAS: Combinatorial number calculations.
5. Iniciales.bas: Asks for the user's name and surnames, then prints out the initials.
6. Divisiones enteras.bas: Performs integer divisions.
7. palabras.bas: A word game where the user inputs a word, and the program prints it in reverse order.
8. Factoriales.bas: Calculates factorials of given numbers.
9. Ecuaciones de 2º grado.bas: Solves second-degree equations.
10. Cronómetro.bas: A simple stopwatch or timer program.
11. Divisores.bas: Finds divisors of a given number.
12. Divisas.bas: A program for currency exchange. It calculates and displays the equivalent amount in either Dollars or Yens.
13. alt.bas: A reflex test where numbers increment in two positions. The user needs to press a key to display the current numbers.
14. Dado.bas: Simulates dice rolls.
15. reflejos.bas: A simplified reflex test where a number increments in one position. The user needs to press a key to display the current number.
16. w.bas: Displays an asterisk on screen with its position changing based on calculations.
17. Lanzamiento dado y reflejos.bas: Combines dice roll simulation with a reflex test.
18. tablas.bas: A multiplication table practice game. The user answers multiplication questions and gets feedback on their answers.
19. media.bas: Calculates the average of a set of numbers.
20. fr.bas: A program that takes a sentence input and breaks it down, displaying each word separately.
21. inkeys.bas: Detects keyboard inputs.
22. Volumen_cilindro.bas: Calculates the volume of a cylinder.
23. Cálculo_del_factorial.BAS: Another program to calculate factorials.
24. redondeo.bas: Rounds off numbers.

## Usage:
These programs were written in BASIC and are best executed in a BASIC interpreter or compiler. Due to their age, compatibility with modern systems may vary. For an authentic experience, consider running them in a vintage computing environment or emulator.

## Contribution:
Feel free to contribute by adding more old-school BASIC programs or suggesting improvements to the existing ones. Let's keep the spirit of early computing alive!

## Note:
These programs are shared for educational and nostalgic purposes. They represent a snapshot of programming at a specific point in time and might not adhere to contemporary best practices.
